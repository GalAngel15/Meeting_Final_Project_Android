## Getting Started
To run this project, follow these steps:
## Configuration Instructions
To run the app properly, you must manually configure your local IP address in the following two places:
1. **`ApiConfig.java`**: Update the `BASE_URL` constant to your local server's IP address.

    ```bash
    app/src/main/java/com/example/meeting_project/apiClients/ApiConfig.java
    ```

   ```java
   public static final String BASE_IP = "http://YOUR_LOCAL_IP";
   ```
   This will enable the app to communicate with your backend microservices (e.g., chat, user, MBTI, etc).

2. **`network_security_config.xml`**: Ensure that the `domain` tag includes your local IP address.

    ```xml
    app/src/main/res/xml/network_security_config.xml
    ```
    Edit the file to allow cleartext HTTP traffic to your development IP address. Replace the <domain> entries accordingly:

   ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <network-security-config>
        <domain-config cleartextTrafficPermitted="true">
            <domain includeSubdomains="true">*.*.*.*</domain>
            <domain includeSubdomains="true">YOUR_LOCAL_IP</domain>
        </domain-config>
    </network-security-config>
    ```

## Tip: You can find your local IP address using the command ipconfig (Windows) or ifconfig (Linux/macOS), under IPv4 Address.
